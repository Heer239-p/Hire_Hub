# Clear All Activities Added! 🗑️✨

## What Was Added

A **"Clear All"** button has been added to the Recent Activity section on the Dashboard!

## Features

### Clear All Button:

✅ **Location** - Top right of Recent Activity card  
✅ **Confirmation Dialog** - Asks "Are you sure?" before clearing  
✅ **Complete Clear** - Removes all activities from state and localStorage  
✅ **Auto-hide** - Only shows when there are activities  
✅ **Page Reset** - Resets pagination to page 1 after clearing  
✅ **Dark Mode** - Styled for both light and dark themes  
✅ **Hover Effect** - Changes color on hover  

### Visual Design:

**Button Style:**
- Light Mode: Red background (`bg-red-100`) with red text
- Dark Mode: Dark red background (`bg-red-900/30`) with light red text
- Hover: Darker red background
- Small, compact design
- Rounded corners

### Layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🕒 Recent Activity  12 total [Clear All]│
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Activity 1                   5 min ago  │
│ Activity 2                  10 min ago  │
│ Activity 3                  15 min ago  │
│ Activity 4                  20 min ago  │
│ Activity 5                  25 min ago  │
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Previous]    Page 1 of 3    [Next]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **See activities** in Recent Activity section
2. **Click "Clear All"** button in top right
3. **Confirmation dialog** appears: "Are you sure you want to clear all activities?"
4. **Click OK** → All activities cleared
5. **Click Cancel** → Nothing happens

### Technical Implementation:

**Function Added:**
```javascript
const clearAllActivities = () => {
  setRecentActivities([]);
  localStorage.setItem("recentActivities", JSON.stringify([]));
  console.log("🗑️ Dashboard: All activities cleared");
};
```

**Button Logic:**
- Only renders when `activities.length > 0`
- Shows confirmation dialog before clearing
- Resets pagination to page 1
- Updates both state and localStorage

## Button States

### Visible:
- When there are 1 or more activities
- Shows in top right corner
- Red color indicates destructive action

### Hidden:
- When there are 0 activities
- Automatically hides to keep UI clean

### Hover:
- Background becomes darker red
- Smooth transition (200ms)
- Cursor changes to pointer

## Dark Mode Support

### Light Mode:
- Background: `bg-red-100`
- Hover: `bg-red-200`
- Text: `text-red-600`

### Dark Mode:
- Background: `bg-red-900/30` (30% opacity)
- Hover: `bg-red-900/50` (50% opacity)
- Text: `text-red-400`

## Safety Features
